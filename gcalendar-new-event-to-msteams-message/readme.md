# Google Calendar Event to Microsoft Teams Channel Message
## Use case
Update your team on the events with the help of Google Calendar and Microsoft Teams. By using this integration, 
we can automatically send a message to a Microsoft Teams channel about the new event.

   access token and refresh token).
